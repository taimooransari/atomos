            ATOMOS is Habib University's flagship Science Olympiad that is back
            with a new twist. ATOMOS covers a wide variety of subjects which are
            not just limited to the field of science. This event is structured
            to have individual modules having their background from one or
            multiple streams which include but are not limited to the Natural
            Sciences, Mathematics, Arts, Logic, Engineering, and Programming.
            The 3-day event is planned to take place on February 3rd, 4th and
            5th.

                The human knowledge of mathematics has evolved tremendously from
                the early days of geometric intuition to modern algebraic
                formalism, from naïve set theory to ZFC. Though this art form of
                pure reasoning is more undervalued by the modern human, Reyaziat
                seeks to reestablish the link. It allows participants to explore
                the beauty of mathematics and will encourage you to reason
                rigorously. If mathematics fascinates you, then this is the
                module for you.
